# RainSimulator
This project preloads an image, in this case a chicken, so that it loads in before any of the code executes.
        It then uses the draw function to create random sized circles that are placed randomly throughout the screen. It
        uses the "get" and "fill" functions to get the color of the background. It then places a circle of that color
        down, recreating the background image, but out of circles.
