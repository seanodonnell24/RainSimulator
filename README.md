# RainSimulator
This project uses perlin noise values to generate a forever changing mountanous landscape. It also has a class
        to create lines that represent the moving rain, as well as creating lightning that flashes once it hits a
        certain y value. Once the rain hits the bottom of the screen, it will call another class that creates blue
        semi-circles, giving the effect that the rain is splashing once it hits the ground. The frequency and magnitude
        of these aspects of the project are controlled by the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Whenever one of the
        buttons is clicked, it will change the amount of raindrops created, as well as increasing the chance for
        lightning to strike. It will also change the speed at which the rain is falling, giving the illusion that it is
        raining harder.
